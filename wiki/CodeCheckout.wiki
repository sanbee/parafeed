= Code distribution =

The project is under active development.  However the author will ensure that the code is usable at any point of time.  Hence, the best way to distribute this code is via anonymous svn checkout.  

A tar-ball of the code will be shortly released for those who don't have svn access.

== Anonymous code checkout ==
